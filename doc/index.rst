 Bob Pipelines
===============

This is a temporary documentation on how this pipeline mechanism is going to work.
This work is heavily based on `dask <https://dask.org/>`_. Hence, have a look in its documentation so see how this works.
For now, we have standardized how:

 - Samples are defined
 - Pipelines are defined
 - The relation with the grid (that's for free using dask)
